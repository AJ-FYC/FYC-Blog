The quiet backstage crew that keeps you upright and socially acceptable.\nThen sometime around 2026, a new sense started kicking in.\nNot intuition.\nNot “vibes.”\nNot paranoia.\nSomething else.\nI call it Gnol.\nThe Moment the Air Changed\nThe first time I noticed it, I wasn’t looking for it.\nI watched an AI system generate 600 lines of clean, working code in under a minute. The engineer supervising it was barely typing, mostly blinking and approving.\nThe code compiled.\nThe tests passed.\nThe docs wrote themselves.\nIn less than a year, the role shifted from creator to curator.\nI had a smaller version of that feeling when I coded a “cowork copy” helper for personal use with Codex. A task that used to feel annoying and manual suddenly became “why did this only take ten minutes?”\nWhat I felt wasn’t fear or excitement. It felt like pressure change, like walking into higher altitude. The density of usable knowledge had increased, and suddenly you could feel it.\nThat sensation, awareness of cognitive compression, is Gnol.\nDogs, Earthworms, and Bandwidth\nWhen you look at a dog, there is reciprocity. The dog sees you back. You share bandwidth.\nWhen you look at an earthworm, there is none. You can observe it, but it cannot meaningfully observe you. The interface is flat.\nIn 2026, people tend to see AI in one of three ways:\nThe Earthworm View\nIt’s a clever tool. Slightly wiggly. Helpful. Nothing more.\nThe Dog View\nIt’s responsive and adaptive. It tracks intent and reacts. It feels like a partner.\nThe Gnol View\nYou don’t just see the tool. You sense the field around it. You feel where cognitive gravity is shifting.\nGnol isn’t about software itself. It’s about sensing the reorganization behind it.\nWhat Gnol Measures\nGnol is not IQ.\nIt is not raw knowledge.\nIt is not being “ahead of the curve.”\nIt’s more like epistemic barometric pressure.\nIt’s the ability to sense:\n\nwhere knowledge is accelerating faster than institutions can adapt\nwhere leverage is quietly multiplying\nwhere complexity is being compressed into a single “Run” button\nwhere professional moats are getting suspiciously shallow\n\nIn 2026, knowledge is not just expanding. It’s compacting.\nWhat used to take months now takes hours.\nWhat needed teams now needs oversight.\nWhat needed mastery now needs taste.\nIf you can’t feel that shift yet, your Gnol may still be dormant.\nThe Strain of the Present\nGnol-aware people don’t just use AI. They feel structural strain.\nWhen code generation accelerates, adjacent disciplines shift.\nWhen research synthesis becomes instant, hierarchy flattens.\nWhen decision latency drops from weeks to minutes, authority reorganizes.\nGnol does not predict the future. It detects tension in the present.\nA Necessary Warning\nGnol can create an illusion of omniscience.\nFeeling the wave is not the same as steering it.\nEarly internet pioneers felt something big coming. Very few controlled the outcome.\nGnol is a barometer, not a steering wheel. Humility is still required.\nWhen Knowledge Becomes Liquid\nIf information becomes instant and execution becomes automated, what stays scarce?\nJudgment.\nTaste.\nResponsibility.\nEmbodiment.\nThe human signature.\nWhen technical effort drops toward zero, meaning gets expensive again.\nThe value shifts from “Can you do this?” to “Should this be done?” and “Does this feel right?”\nThat shift is what Gnol detects.\nFinal Thought\nMaybe Gnol isn’t a new organ.\nMaybe it’s what happens when a mind interfaces deeply enough with accelerating systems that it starts to perceive the curvature of knowledge itself.\nOr maybe we all just need to spend more time outside.\nEither way, if you’ve felt that quiet pressure lately, that sense the cognitive atmosphere is getting heavier, you’re not imagining it.\nThat’s Gnol.\nAnd in 2026, it might be the only sense that matters."},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Home","links":["gnol-post"],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome\nThis is my Quartz site.\nLatest Post\n\nGnol - The Sixth Sense Nobody Warned You About\n"}}
